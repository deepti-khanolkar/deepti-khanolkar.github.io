                        <h2>Neuroplasticity<br></h2>
                        <p>Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to adapt and change throughout an individual’s life. Research has shown that the brain is constantly re-shaping, re-wiring and changing itself. Therefore, everything we do, from practising a skill, to reading a blog or kicking a football has an impact on our brain.

                        <h2>Here comes the reflection of 'My Foundations' Journey'</h2>
                        <p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 30px;">
                            Throughout my foundations' journey, I discovered a lot about myself. Some of the things are as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>I do shy away from asking my peers when I am stuck with any code.</li>
                                <li>I felt good after using the ‘calm’ app, and that taking some downtime really helps.</li>
                                <li>Listening and looping exercises helped me to open up to a complete stranger (who is now my good friend)</li>
                            </ul>
                            </br></br>We humans are quite blessed by the gift of self-awareness. This gift, if used in a proper way, will help us in our day to day life and also in our professional life. We are defined by our core values and our level of empathy towards others. So if you are a good human being, you will have an open mind and will be able to grasp more, resulting in more learning. And to be a good programmer, we have to be a good learner. That sums up how important values, empathy and self-awareness are for learning and programming.
                            <br></br>What surprised me the most about core learning is the importance of this skill in the work place. This skill to understand the people you will be working with as a client and also your co-workers is essential to deliver a better product. You can further improve your product by recognizing the end users and their needs. Our emotional quotient is more important than our intelligence quotient.
                            </br></br>The most challenging aspect of core learning for me, was to understand new terms like ‘Neuroplasticity / Growth mindset’ and then explain in my own words. Designing the individual pages according to the topic was also another task. Using different strategies suggested was also challenging.
                            </br></br>In the beginning of the course I felt that why is the core part even there. I can better use my time to learn more programming skills. But now I feel that it is equally important. And I do understand why EDA includes 'The core' part to our learning; the recruiting companies these days search for candidates who will be able to work in a team. His/her contribution is not only going to be restricted to coding but also towards team building. A successful candidate will be the one who can co-exist in harmony.
