                <h1>Values:</h1>
                <p>These are 3 of my core values:
                <ol>
                    <li>Honesty</li>
                    <li>Perfection</li>
                    <li>Perseverance</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Honesty is one of my core personal values. However, Truth is not always popular or convenient. In one such instance I had to stand for the truth which turned a few people against me. While I was satisfied that I stood by the truth, it was a stressful time for me socially. Since I am a very social person it affected me emotionally. This gave an opportunity to learn to control my emotions and go on with life. However, when people started realising the truth over the course of months, the same people turned apologetic towards me. Truth eventually prevailed.

                “Satyamev Jayate” in Sanskrit which means “Truth Alone Triumps” is one of the core Indian cultural values from the Vedic times (written in ancient texts of the Upanishads), and is also inscribed on the National emblem of India, which is where I come from.

                <p><strong>Stengths and Limitations:</strong>
                </br>My pursuit of Perfection is both my strength as well as can be a limitation sometimes. Since I look for perfection I have always been a high achiever, but it sometimes puts undue stress on myself and others which can distract me from other aspects of my life. My pursuit for Perfection also contributes to my ‘Attention to detail’ quality which helps me identify potential errors and improve upon them.
                </br>Similarly my perseverance has helped me get through difficult times. 
                </p>
                <p>One of the example I can think of in my work place is Once one of my colleague was quite snappy and would not think twice before using rude language. This quite surprised me because I had a really good relationship with her. At first I tried to figure out why she’s behaving the way she was but nothing popped up. I also tried to reason out that it might be something from my side that has got about this change in her. But I could think of nothing that I might have done wrong towards her. For next some days I started avoiding her. This started affecting our social circle at work and brought about awkward situations. I had enough and couldn’t work in such conditions. I decided to talk it out with her but to my disappointment nothing worked. Lastly, when I couldn’t control outside factors, I decided to control my emotions. This involved forgiving someone for my own sake. Now both of us are happy to work around each other without expecting much  from each other.
