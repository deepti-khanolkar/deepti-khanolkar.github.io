                <h3>These are some of the Problem solving techniques:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pseudocode</li>
                    <li>The rubber ducky method</li>
                    <li>Reading error messages</li>
                    <li>Console.logging</li>
                    <li>Googling</li>
                    <li>Trying something</li>
                    <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                    <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                    <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Some of these techniques just come naturally to you depending on what kind of programmer you are. Like for me 'Reading error messages, Googling, Trying something and Asking coaches for help' are the methods I am comfortable with. Recently I started using 'Console.logging' after consulting my facilitator. This proved to be very helpful technique. Whereas other techniques will need me to go out of my comfort zone to try, like 'Asking my peers for help'. This is because I will have to overcome my fear of getting judged by others. I will be trying this in future though because if I go to think we are all in the same boat. 'Reflections' are also very helpful and will avoid repetition of the same mistake. 'Pseudocode' is another technique I am trying to work on. This method helps to plan and start the process of coding. Lastly, I had not heard about 'The rubber ducky method' earlier. I did my research and felt that it's quite an unusual way of problem-solving. But this seems helpful when you are alone and have no one to turn to. This little ducky will give you the listening ear that you need without being interrupted.

                    There was time when I was stuck with a simple problem. The problem was the installation of node.js. No matter what I tried, I just couldn't install it. I followed all the steps, tried again, google searched and finally ended up asking my facilitator. Together we spent couple of hours trying different ways and finally successfully installed it. During this process, I felt a lot of things. I felt anxious and worried that if I can't install this now I won't be able to carry on with my coding. At the end, I learnt that persistence make things happen. And persistence should be accompanied by keeping cool.

                    Another instance was when I couldn't do one of the built-in method code. I tried coding, went through the test code, read error messages, googled and then I asked my facilitator. That's when I realised that console.log works in any situation. Again during this process I felt that if I can't do this code now then how will I cope with the complex coding in the future. But once I completed my code, I felt such a sense of satisfaction and achievement. Don't give up is the motto. Anything is possible through practice and diligence.
