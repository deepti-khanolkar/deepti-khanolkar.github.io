                <ul>                      
                    <li>My long term goal and/or career pathway:
                    </br>My long term goal is to get a job in my field of IT. I like coding in general so a career in that is what I am looking for.
                    </li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Strengths and limitations:
                    </br>My strengths can sometimes be my limitations. Honesty, Perfection and Perserevance. All these qualities of mine help me in achieving my goals and never let me go out of focus.
                    </li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Non-technical - human skills development:
                    </br>Human skills that I can think of that would benefit me in my career is how to crack an interview. By the end of this course I expect myself to be confident enough to answer an interview.
                    </li>
                    </br>
                    <li>Commitment to manage my workload: 
                    </br>I think I have already proved to myself about my  management of this course even when I am working. At the bootcamp, I will have more time to only dedicate to DEV course since I have taken a break from work then. I will keep in touch with my colleagues and facilitators and try my best to work effectively in harmonious environment. I will also try to reach out to people for help and also be available when they need support.
                         I will try my best not to keep anything pending. I will always try to stay at or ahead of the timeline. But if any uncertain thing stops me from doing so then I will break it up in sub parts and try to finish. I will let my facilitator know about my situation too.
                         I am  committed to complete this course with all my hardwork and perseverance. 
                         I am quite lucky to have a very supportive husband who has taken over the responsibilities of our kids and some of the household chores. Infact he's the one who researched this course and encouraged me to do it. My husband works from home, this has made things quite easy for me. Bonus my lovely children are old enough and are very understanding and independent.
                    </li>
                    </br>
                    <li>My expectations from the facilitation team:
                    </br>I expect that I would get necessary help from the facilitation team when I need it. I also would expect them to assist me in getting a job, suitable for me, after the course.
